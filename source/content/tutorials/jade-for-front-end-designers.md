I love Jade templates! They feel efficient and malleable. It's so easy to make pages and components in a modular way and it fits in well with the syntax of Stylus and Coffeescript. Jade was originally created for writing web apps so why are we using it to author static sites?

I never had the *pleasure* of writing too much HTML markup by hand so I don't feel any "traditionalist" attachment to the `<>` ornateness of raw markup.
